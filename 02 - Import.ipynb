    "Lastly, I used a new python library to futher build on top of my current datasets called Natural Language Tool Kit. As my challenge area, I used this library since it had a well known Sentiment Analysis tool called Vader which assigned polarity scores for a given headline. These polarity scores gave a percentage of a texts positivity, neutrality, and negativity. A compound score is also inclued which is an aggregate score of the three sentiments.\n"
