    "Volatility, uncertainty, and manipulation are just a few words that come to mind when I picture the stock market. As a previous business major, I was always interested in the stock market and what drives its volatility. I was curious learning about an investor's decision making when choosing a company to invest in and from what I've observed, a person decision is based off what they read or see in the news. In other words, I hypothesize that the market is driven by people's reaction to the news. In this project, I explore the relationships between stock market quotes and news headlines, datasets from Kaggle.\n",
